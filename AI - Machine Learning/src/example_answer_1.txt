"Churn" refers to the situation where customers stop using a product or service. In the context of the example I provided, the dataset includes information about whether each customer has stopped using the product or service ("churned") or is still using it. This information can be used as the target variable (or response variable) for a machine learning model, with the goal of predicting which customers are likely to churn in the future based on their demographics and purchase history. The model can then be used to take proactive steps to retain those customers and reduce the overall churn rate.<|im_end|>
