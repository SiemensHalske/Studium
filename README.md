# Java Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Java programming exercises designed to cover a variety of core concepts and challenges. Each directory corresponds to a specific task and contains the Java source code that provides a solution to the given problem.

## Contents

- `RecursiveGCD` - A program that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion.
- `PalindromeChecker` - A method that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- `DoubleMultiplier` - A simple program that multiplies two decimal numbers and prints the result formatted to two decimal places.
- `SieveOfEratosthenesTurbo` - An optimized implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding prime numbers.
- `StickGame` - A game where the computer plays against a human by removing sticks from a pile.
- `GradeCalculator` - A program that calculates a grade based on a score using a set grading scale.
- `DiceSimulation` - A simulation that rolls a die 100,000 times and prints the frequency of each outcome.
- `GCDCalculator` - A tool that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers.

## Installation

No installation is required. You can run each program by compiling the `.java` files using `javac` and then executing them with `java`.

Example:

```bash
javac RecursiveGCD.java
java RecursiveGCD

```
