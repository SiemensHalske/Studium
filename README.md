# Java Programming and AI-Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a diverse collection of programming exercises covering a variety of core concepts and challenges in Java and AI-Machine Learning. The Java exercises are located in the `Java` directory, while the AI-Machine Learning content is in the `AI-Machine Learning` directory. Each directory corresponds to a specific task and contains the source code that provides a solution to the given problem.

## Contents

- `/Java`: Java programming exercises.
  - `RecursiveGCD` - Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion.
  - `PalindromeChecker` - Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
  - `DoubleMultiplier` - Multiplies two decimal numbers and prints the result formatted to two decimal places.
  - `SieveOfEratosthenesTurbo` - An optimized implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding prime numbers.
  - `StickGame` - A game where the computer plays against a human by removing sticks from a pile.
  - `GradeCalculator` - Calculates a grade based on a score using a set grading scale.
  - `DiceSimulation` - Simulates a dice roll and prints the frequency of each outcome.
  - `GCDCalculator` - Finds the greatest common divisor of two integers.

- `/AI-Machine Learning`: AI and Machine Learning related exercises and demonstrations (Content details to be provided by the repo owner).

## Installation

No installation is required for the Java programs. You can run each program by compiling the `.java` files using `javac` and then executing them with `java`.

For the AI-Machine Learning content, please refer to the specific README.md in the `AI-Machine Learning` directory for instructions.

## Usage

To compile and run a Java program, navigate to the `Java` directory and use the following commands:

```bash
javac Java/RecursiveGCD.java
java Java/RecursiveGCD

```
